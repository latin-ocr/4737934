This ree! of microfiim contains materiai
which has paper color changes stains or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text and illustrations are
iegibie, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore‚ when text and illustrations exist
in a sinqie' image or when materiai
bacquounds differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects the camera f
operator’s best effert to capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure reflects the

camera operator’s best effort to capture
iliustrative materiai or the remaining text. it -

is hoped that this practice witi result in a

microfiim product that fuuy serves tite needs .
